      <description>Background # After getting my Delta 15 back from RMA due to battery issues, I decided to upgrade it with the Ram and SSD i bought for my drop-in replacement - the HP Elitebook, as well as an extra 16GB stick for a total of 32GB of RAM, especially since I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into virtualization and other goodies like Windows VMs on Linux.</description>

      <description>Background # While my MSI Delta 15 was in RMA, thanks to battery issues I might go into more detail about in a different post, I had to switch back to my old laptop for school, which was this 2019 Hp Elitebook 830 g6 I bought from my school back in 2020.</description>

      <description>Checking If The Console Was Patched # A while ago, I became keen to experiment on my V1 Switch which I got in around 2018, and since it was just sitting in my closet gathering dust, I decided to play around with the software and see if I could get homebrew working.</description>

      <description>Beginning # Back in around Q3 2020, my old ROG GL552VW gaming laptop with a 960M and i7 6700HQ was starting to get really slow, and unable to play newer games at the 60fps mark, and struggling to even get 30fps in some cases – which is why I decided to build my pc: I already had most of my peripherals prior to the PC, such as the Corsair K68 Red keyboard I picked up during my Osu phase.</description>
