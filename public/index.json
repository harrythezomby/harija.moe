However, thanks to Asus Linux\u0026rsquo;s awesome passthrough tutorial, I was able to get my GPU passed through to my Windows 11 VM, as well as getting Looking Glass working, creating a great way to use Microsoft Word at 240 fps\u0026hellip; I mean game :)\nFollowing The Tutorial # The tutorial was pretty straightforward, I was already using supergfxctl to switch between Hybrid and Integrated graphics modes, and the VFIO mode helped me easily get my dGPU geared up for my virtual machine. In terms of the libvirt hooks, I basically copied most of what was covered in the tutorial, apart from the Nvidia specific optimizations of course, however I did have to make a few alterations which I\u0026rsquo;ll get into later. However, once the VM booted and I could see the dGPU in Windows task manager, I had a complete Eureka Moment!\nErrors I Occured # As I was getting the VM set up, I encountered a couple of problems:\n1. Radeon Drivers Kept Crashing / Warning Triangle in Device Manager # This one had me pretty confused and distraught at first, however the fix ended up being simple. I had just forgotten to pass through the GPU\u0026rsquo;s audio driver as well. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think this would be a big deal since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning on using HDMI/DP audio, but turns out the GPU won\u0026rsquo;t function properly without its second half. So basically, make sure to pass through all the bits of your GPU, even if they\u0026rsquo;re in different IOMMU groups.\n2. Virt-Manager / Laptop Hard Freezes When Shutting Down VM # I figured this one had something to do with supergfxctl switching back from VFIO to Integrated mode via the libvirt hook, which was mentioned in the Asus Linux guide. To fix this one, I simply just added a sleep 3 in the VM\u0026rsquo;s poweroff hook just before supergfxctl -m Integrated was run. I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure what this meant, I\u0026rsquo;m guessing by default, the VM doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time to completely unhook the GPU, which causes the entire system to just crash. I originally thought this might\u0026rsquo;ve been a Hyprland/Wayland specific issue, but I guess not.\nThanks for Reading!\n","date":"6 December 2023","permalink":"/posts/gpu-passthrough/","section":"Posts","summary":"Background # Originally, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t completely sure if passing through a Radeon laptop GPU, such as the RX6700m in my MSI Delta 15 would be possible, since all the tutorials I could find were for Intel + Nvidia or AMD + Nvidia.","title":"RX6700m VFIO VM Passthrough"},{"content":"Background # After getting my Delta 15 back from RMA due to battery issues, I decided to upgrade it with the Ram and SSD i bought for my drop-in replacement - the HP Elitebook, as well as an extra 16GB stick for a total of 32GB of RAM, especially since I\u0026rsquo;ve been getting into virtualization and other goodies like Windows VMs on Linux.\nUpgrades # 2 x 16GB Crucial 3200mhz SODIMMs (which annoyingly were slightly different - same model but different submodel, meaning that one stick had double the memory modules/chips on one side as the other, but performance and stability looks fine.) 1TB ADATA Legend 850 Lite SSD Opening It Up # Just like the Elitebook, our Delta 15 was pretty easy to get the bottom cover off, just having to take off the Philips head screws and pry the corners a bit to pop the cover off.

Repasting # I figured it would be a good idea to repaste, since I thought that the factory thermal paste application would be mediocre, and boy was it right! Looking at the picture above, hopefully you can see that interestingly there was more paste outside of the CPU die than ontop of it. I used Cooler Master MasterGel Maker, since it was the most suitable thing for a laptop (high viscosity and pretty good thermal conductivity) to repaste the CPU, GPU, and VRM. Here\u0026rsquo;s a picture of the laptop\u0026rsquo;s heat pipes removed: Closing It Back Up # Having finished the upgrades and repasting, I popped the heat pipes back on, and popped the motherboard back into the laptop\u0026rsquo;s frame, followed by putting all the ribbon cables and connectors back into their respective positions. Finally, I popped the bottom cover\u0026rsquo;s Phillips Head screws back on, and that was it.\nGreasing The Hinges # Recently, my hinges have been starting to creak when opening the laptop, and knowing Msi\u0026rsquo;s infamous hinges, I decided it would be best to grease the hinges as a preventative measure. After prying open the screen\u0026rsquo;s plastic bezel, which was slightly annoying and finicky, I made sure to tighten the hinge screws, before applying some white Lithium Grease to the hinges on each side. I used Lithum Grease meant for mountain bikes, but hey, if it works it works! Here\u0026rsquo;s a look into what went down here: Fixing Clicking Sound When Opening Lid # Ever since I bought this laptop a little over a year ago, the top left corner of the laptop (the corner directly opposite to the thunderbird logo) has been making this annoying magentic-sounding clicking sound. My temporary fix was to pop a small magnet on that area of the lid making the sound, which seemed to fix it. However, I wanted to take it a step further, and while tidying up everything else on the machine, I removed the bezel in that specific corner to take a look at what was going on. Turns out, a small magnetic piece was kinda loose and disloged at one end, causing the clicking sound when opening and closing the lid, securing it with a little piece of electrical tape did the trick of fixing it, and the bezel popped back on with no issue.

Discrete GPU\u0026rsquo;s SSID/SVID: Manufacturer -\u0026gt; Keep Default Setting (By default, the DGPU\u0026rsquo;s card ID is 0, and the integrated GPU\u0026rsquo;s is 1, this makes it so that the dGPU uses the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; setting, which allows it to be disabled.) To disable the card even more (if that\u0026rsquo;s how it works)\u0026hellip; Under Advanced -\u0026gt; Demo Board -\u0026gt; PCI-E Port, set Device 1 Fun 1\u0026rsquo;s ASPM Mode to L0s Entry, and its Hotplug Mode to Hotplug Inboard. I presume these settings make the dGPU go into it\u0026rsquo;s highest level of sleep by default, and set the default card to the onboard GPU respectively. What Happens # After making these changes, the laptop should boot up into Windows or Linux or whatever you\u0026rsquo;re using with the red power light on, indicating the dGPU is active for a few seconds to a minute. After that, if everything worked out, it should switch to the white light, and the dGPU shouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn back on, even if doing demanding tasks until these settings are changed back. Moreover, if you\u0026rsquo;re using Windows, the dGPU should have vanished from task manager\u0026rsquo;s system information - I\u0026rsquo;ve found that only changing a few of these settings can lead to the dGPU still being in task manager, and thus allowing Windows to still access it. I\u0026rsquo;ve also found that in Linux, sometimes doing a system info command like neofetch causes the light to turn red, however the dGPU is once again absent from neofetch, and the light turns back white shortly, so while this isn\u0026rsquo;t a 100% fix for disabling the dGPU, it still works pretty well most of the time.\nOr\u0026hellip; If you\u0026rsquo;re on Linux # Just use Asus Linux\u0026rsquo;s Supergfxctl, it\u0026rsquo;s way less buggy and hacky, and works with other laptops apart from Asus ones, like the Msi over here.

However, the arm was a bit small so I’m no longer able to curve the monitors inward for Sim games like I was before, but the ability to go vertical is a big plus for things like web browsing and coding: Recent Upgrades # Last week (as of writing this), I got a Cooler Master Illusion ML360 AIO, mainly for the included ARGB controller, which allowed me to utilize OpenRGB to the fullest (more on that on a future post). I also got some more RAM – 2 sticks of 8gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 3600mhz. (Yes, I’m mixing ram, and yes, its stable… so far): I decided to move my PC up to my desk to admire the rgb to the fullest, so I also moved the fans of the AIO to under the radiator: Stay Tuned # So far, this is what the PC looks like. However, I have a bunch of cool (and cheap!) goodies coming from AliExpress to play around with in the PC, so stay tuned for the incoming post!\nThanks for reading!\nHarija\n","date":"15 August 2023","permalink":"/projects/pc-upgrading/","section":"Projects","summary":"Beginning # Back in around Q3 2020, my old ROG GL552VW gaming laptop with a 960M and i7 6700HQ was starting to get really slow, and unable to play newer games at the 60fps mark, and struggling to even get 30fps in some cases – which is why I decided to build my pc: I already had most of my peripherals prior to the PC, such as the Corsair K68 Red keyboard I picked up during my Osu phase.","title":"PC Upgrading"},{"content":"Uses: # Here\u0026rsquo;s a bit of info on what I use day-to-day on my computers.\nMain Stuff # I use vanilla Arch Linux btw.
