However most Msi laptops come with a neat hotkey to enable a bunch of wild and wacky Bios settings. The hotkey is Left Alt + F2 + Right Ctrl + Right Shift - (just make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t have the fn lock on as it won\u0026rsquo;t work with it on).\nWarning # Make sure not to change anything that sound like it may brick your laptop, as chances are - it might, hopefully not though.\nSettings To Change # I\u0026rsquo;ve personally found that changing the settings under the Advanced -\u0026gt; AMD PBS tab does the trick (I\u0026rsquo;ve included a brief explaination of what I think each setting does.):\nSpecial Display Features: HybridGraphics -\u0026gt; Disabled (Disables the system\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Hybrid Graphics\u0026rsquo; mode technically, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t do enough to stop the dGPU from being used all the time.) Discrete GPU Hotplug Mode: Enhanced Mode -\u0026gt; Basic Mode (Likely makes it so that the GPU cannot be changed while the system is active.) Discrete GPU HPD Circuitry: OR Circuitry -\u0026gt; Pulse Circuitry (No idea lol) Discrete GPU\u0026rsquo;s Audio and USB Port: ROM Strap/Default -\u0026gt; Disabled (Disabling features of the dGPU?) Discrete GPU\u0026rsquo;s SSID/SVID: Manufacturer -\u0026gt; Keep Default Setting (By default, the DGPU\u0026rsquo;s card ID is 0, and the integrated GPU\u0026rsquo;s is 1, this makes it so that the dGPU uses the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; setting, which allows it to be disabled.) To disable the card even more (if that\u0026rsquo;s how it works)\u0026hellip; Under Advanced -\u0026gt; Demo Board -\u0026gt; PCI-E Port, set Device 1 Fun 1\u0026rsquo;s ASPM Mode to L0s Entry, and its Hotplug Mode to Hotplug Inboard. I presume these settings make the dGPU go into it\u0026rsquo;s highest level of sleep by default, and set the default card to the onboard GPU respectively. What Happens # After making these changes, the laptop should boot up into Windows or Linux or whatever you\u0026rsquo;re using with the red power light on, indicating the dGPU is active for a few seconds to a minute. After that, if everything worked out, it should switch to the white light, and the dGPU shouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn back on, even if doing demanding tasks until these settings are changed back. Moreover, if you\u0026rsquo;re using Windows, the dGPU should have vanished from task manager\u0026rsquo;s system information - I\u0026rsquo;ve found that only changing a few of these settings can lead to the dGPU still being in task manager, and thus allowing Windows to still access it. I\u0026rsquo;ve also found that in Linux, sometimes doing a system info command like neofetch causes the light to turn red, however the dGPU is once again absent from neofetch, and the light turns back white shortly, so while this isn\u0026rsquo;t a 100% fix for disabling the dGPU, it still works pretty well most of the time.\n","date":"10 October 2023","permalink":"/posts/delta15dgpudisable/","section":"Posts","summary":"Background # If you\u0026rsquo;re like me and have got an Msi Delta 15 or similar Msi laptop with a dGPU, you can probably disable it to get way more battery life, since even light apps can randomly cause it to turn on for no reason.","title":"How To Disable The dGPU On The MSI Delta 15"},{"content":"","date":"10 October 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" Checking If The Console Was Patched # A while ago, I became keen to experiment on my V1 Switch which I got in around 2018, and since it was just sitting in my closet gathering dust, I decided to play around with the software and see if I could get homebrew working. First of all, I made sure to check my Switch’s serial number to see if it was patched or not – luckily it wasn’t.\nRecovery Mode (RCM) # Next up was getting into recovery mode. Unlike androids, you can’t enter recovery mode simply with the press of a few buttons during boot – and I can see why, from the point of view of the giant console companies why would they want people messing around with stuff they shouldn’t? Well, in this case it was simply a matter of shorting a pin in the right Joycon from memory. I used the aluminum foil method was this, since I didn’t want to wait for a RCM jig to get delivered.\nCFW Time # After a bunch of trial and error, I finally got it to work, and got Hekate and Atmosphere up and running using a 128GB SanDisk Ultra micro–SD I got for this project a few days prior. Anyway, playing around with all the cool new features was really fun – especially themes.\nShell Modding # Fast forwarding to a while later, I decided to try modding the console physically as well, with a transparent blue shell for the console and joy-cons, as well as purple buttons for the joy-cons from AliExpress. For me personally it was a nightmare moving the Joycon mainboards between the shells – and rightfully so, since I guess Nintendo didn’t design them with people doing silly mods like this in mind.\nWhoops! # If you noticed from the pictures that the batteries are missing from the controllers – you’d be right. I ended up breaking off the left battery connector when trying to take the battery out, so I just didn’t bother with the right’s battery.

A few years back, I got a Logitech g923 along with the Logitech Shifter to get into Sim racing: Deep Dish Wheel # As you can see in the picture above, I did try upgrading the shift knob of the shifter with this interesting long metal knob I found on AliExpress. However, after seeing quite a few Youtubers with deep dish wheels on their G29s, G920s and G923s, I decided to try it for myself. I ordered an Alcantara deep dish with blue accents from AliExpress, and the adapter to fit it on the wheelbase from eBay. Surprisingly, the actual wheel coming from China arrived a few days faster than the adapter which came from another state of Australia. Here’s a pic of the deep dish: Switching Out The Wheels # The process of switching out the stock wheel for the deep dish was fairly straightforward – I had to first take the old wheel and motherboard off, and then screw the motherboard onto the wheelbase itself, before screwing in the adapter to the front followed by the deep dish. Here’s the finished product: Post Upgrade + Shifter Mod # After the upgrade, the wheel felt great – although the wheel’s force feedback was slightly reduced, not to mention the distance of the wheel from the paddle shifters – making it pretty difficult to shift with them. However, since this is a real car steering wheel, it makes sims way more immersive thanks to the substantially increased diameter compared to the stock wheel. I also installed the Clixbeetle tactile shifter mod from nolitto3d for the shifter which also greatly improved the shifter’s feel and performance, as well as some shifter handles such as the 3d printed Sparco one - which I forgot to dive into deeper in this post.\nThanks for reading!\nHarija\n","date":"17 August 2023","permalink":"/projects/g923-mods/","section":"Projects","summary":"Introduction # This is an older project, as I’ve since lost most of my interest in sim-racing and driving thanks to getting my Learners License in real life.","title":"Logitech G923 Deep Dish Mod (+ Shifter Mods)"},{"content":" Introduction # Recently, I picked up a HK Gaming GK61 from Amazon. It’s a pretty cheap per-key RGB (although fairly limited) hot swappable keyboard – mechanical of course. I actually got the wrong version at first – the one with optical switches rather than mechanical switches, which I soon (after diving deeper into the keyboard rabbit hole) realized was a very silly move.\nKeycaps On Original # Here’s a picture of the original keyboard I got with the Gateron Optical Blue switches, before and after I put on my Blue and Pink Pudding Keycaps: Rookie Mistake # As mentioned earlier, I soon realized that getting a keyboard with optical hot swaps wasn’t the best idea for customization ability. So, thanks to Amazons pretty good returns system I managed to return this one (after painstakingly taking off the new keycaps and putting the old ones back on). I then made sure to order the version with the Gateron Mechanical Blue’s, however black was the only color available, so I came up with the debatably smart idea of using Washi Tape on the sides.\nAkko Switches # After everything came, I immediately got to work by hot swapping the Gateron Blue switches (which I personally dislike… a lot) with these Akko CS Lavenders I thought seemed nice (spoiler alert: I was right… they’re great!): Taped Sides # After swapping in the new switches, I got to work on the taped sides. Also, yes, I put the spare keycaps on my Corsair K68 – just for fun! Here’s the finished product of the keyboard: Using the Switches # I was honestly blown away by these switches – they’re amazing to type on! I love the ‘thock’ they make, and their stability compared to the old Gaterons on the board – especially when you consider that they’re just $20 for a pack of 45. Just to end, here’s an arbitrary sound comparison between the old Gaterons (although the optical version on the first keyboard) and the mechanical Akkos (which is unnecessarily long).\nOptical Gateron Blues: Mechanical Akko CS Lavender Purples: As you can hear, the Gateron’s have a more ‘pingy’ sound, which I personally dislike – and the Akko’s have that sort of more ‘thocky’ noise, which I do love. It took quite a bit to get used to not having number keys and a number pad and stuff like that, but I’m having loads of fun with this board.\nThanks for reading!\nHarija\n","date":"16 August 2023","permalink":"/projects/amazon-keyboard/","section":"Projects","summary":"Introduction # Recently, I picked up a HK Gaming GK61 from Amazon.","title":"Customizing a $30 Amazon Keyboard!"},{"content":" Gaming: # I love playing all sorts of games, ranging from Racing/Driving Sims, to FPS’, to Japanese Anime and Visual Novel games.

I’ve been having a blast, so I decided to give it a few upgrades. Here’s what it originally looked like stock: Contact Points # I started by upgrading the seat post to a dropper, as well as contact points such pedals and grips. I quite liked the stock saddle however and think it fit me well, so I decided it didn’t need upgrading. Here’s how it looked after all that: Dropper Post # I went with a 200mm travel PNW Rainier Gen 3 for the dropper, however I didn’t realize that the dropper wouldn’t go all the way to the bottom of the seat tube thanks to the bottle cage mounting points. The Rainiers travel adjust feature saved me though, and after knocking off 30mm I was at the perfect position. I also went with the Burgtec Bartender grips since I quite liked how the ‘Playdough’ color had a bunch of different colors mixed. For the peddles I went with the Dabomb double cross alloy, since they were only $50 for the pair, and they’re great especially for the price – and they look nice in person thanks to the blue-colored alloy. The dropper post was a nightmare to install though, it took literal hours to get the cable through the frame, and quite a white to take the bike’s rubber cable ports out since they were in pretty tight.\nMaxxis Tires # Soon after that, I decided that the tires were next: The bike’s stock tires didn’t have much grip – not the mention the tan sidewalls which I personally don’t really like. I went with the 2.5 Minion DHF at the front, and the 2.3 Minion DHR on the rear. However, they are the dual compounds since I picked them up for a good price. I think the bike overall looks really clean and nice looking with the Maxxis tires on. Here’s a comparison of the old and new tires: Gallery # Finally, here’s some other pictures I took… (I’m not much of a picture guy so that explains why they’re pretty poor quality)\nDropper Lever and Grips: Next to a local trail: Getting lost late at night at the trails… Thanks for reading!\nHarija\n","date":"15 August 2023","permalink":"/projects/entry-level-hardtail-upgrades/","section":"Projects","summary":"Introduction # So, I recently picked up a Marin Bobcat Trail 3 to get into mountain biking.","title":"Entry-Level Hardtail Upgrades!"},{"content":" Beginning # Back in around Q3 2020, my old ROG GL552VW gaming laptop with a 960M and i7 6700HQ was starting to get really slow, and unable to play newer games at the 60fps mark, and struggling to even get 30fps in some cases – which is why I decided to build my pc: I already had most of my peripherals prior to the PC, such as the Corsair K68 Red keyboard I picked up during my Osu phase.

First Upgrade: Case Fans # About a year or so after that, I made my first upgrade, which were some Amazon ‘ez-diy-fab’ brand ARGB ring fans. Here’s a pic, along with what was my online school setup at the time: Desk and Sim Setup # Another year after that, I finally upgraded my desk to a Eureka Ergonomic ‘gaming desk’, since my old one was very, very wobbly, not to mention all the times my legs bumped into the back. Here’s a couple of pics, including with my G923 which I also got around the time for games like Forza and Euro Truck Simulator: Monitors # Trying out some old monitors from my childhood: Soon my main monitor started having these weird artefacts after a cold start, with them disappearing once the monitor ‘warmed up’ after around 5 minutes or so. This was pretty annoying, so I upgraded to a 200hz MSI ultrawide for my main monitor, whilst using the old Viewsonic as a second monitor, as the lines weren’t too big an issue for a second screen: A while after that, I found a couple of 90hz Lenovo ultrawides for AU$250 each, which looked pretty similar from the front to my main monitor, so I picked up two of them for a more immersive sim experience. After a bit of tinkering with custom resolutions and monitor timings, I got the three of them to work together with Nvidia surround to stretch my games and sims across: One of my friends (who goes by UntitledDuck) was upgrading to Corsair QL fans, so he gave me 4 of his old LL120’s along with the Rgb controller: Later, I decided to get a monitor arm since each monitor’s stand was taking up a lot of desk space. However, the arm was a bit small so I’m no longer able to curve the monitors inward for Sim games like I was before, but the ability to go vertical is a big plus for things like web browsing and coding: Recent Upgrades # Last week (as of writing this), I got a Cooler Master Illusion ML360 AIO, mainly for the included ARGB controller, which allowed me to utilize OpenRGB to the fullest (more on that on a future post). I also got some more RAM – 2 sticks of 8gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 3600mhz. (Yes, I’m mixing ram, and yes, its stable… so far): I decided to move my PC up to my desk to admire the rgb to the fullest, so I also moved the fans of the AIO to under the radiator: Stay Tuned # So far, this is what the PC looks like.
