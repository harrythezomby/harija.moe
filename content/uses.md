## Uses:
Here's a bit of info on what I use day-to-day on my computers.
All dots and other configs can be found here, at my dotfiles repo:
{{< github repo="harrythezomby/dotfiles" >}}

## Main Stuff
![Laptop Arch](/img/uses/newdesktop.png)
- I use vanilla [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) btw. I love its customisability and the fact that it only has as much bloat as I want it to!
- For my window manager/wayland compositor, I use [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/). Hyprland's silky smooth animations are great, especially on high refresh monitors.
- Along with Hyprland, I use [Aylur's GTK Shell](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) for creating cool widgets - such as my top status bar. For my launchers I use the Wayland port of [rofi](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi), and [swaync](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter) for notifications.
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is my go-to terminal, mainly since I've grown used to it, being Hyprland's default terminal and all. It's pretty fast and customizable too which is nice. Paired with Kitty, I use zsh for my shell, along with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
## Other Applications
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for basic text-editing, including editing config files.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for heavier coding and bigger projects.
- [Nautilus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Files) for file browsing. It's not the most feature-rich, but it looks pretty nice, just for those times im not ls -l'ing or cd'ing inside a terminal.
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) for all my school and personal note taking. I love how it's privacy focused with E2EE, as well as its expandability and theme-ability with plugins and custom CSS. I'm also running an instance of Joplin Server, which helps me get all my notes synced up, and lets me share them via URL if need be. Check out my custom Joplin theme at my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/harrythezomby/dotfiles).

## Server + Sites
- I run [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) on my server. It's actually been very stable believe it or not.
- I build all my sites with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is great for creating fast static sites. This one in particular's running the [Blowfish Theme](https://blowfish.page/), which I also love.
