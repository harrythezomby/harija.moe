## Background
So... I had been wanting to upgrade to a stronger cpu with a lot more cores so I could pin an entire CCX to my Windows VM for better latency, whilst also having some cores available for my host for basic tasks but also for building and compiling stuff when updating git packages in particular.

## Experience
Everything went great, although the 5950x did run quite a bit hotter on my 360mil AIO. Being able to basically have two 5800x's - one for my Windows VM and the other for my host has been great. Although I am a little jealous of 7950x owners, who *also* get a good boost to gaming performance within their VM thanks to the 3d cache :D.
