## Stuff
Just a quick post here where I wanted to talk about the Gear S3 Frontier I got my hands on. For an over 8 year old watch, it's surprisingly fast to date, especially compared to my daily driver for the last four years - the Fitbit Versa 3. 

Now obviously the Fitbit is more of a fitness tracker than a smartwatch, but the 8-year-old Gear S3 Frontier still feels way more smoother in comparison, not to mention stuff like music controls, apps, etc being much better. 

Using the rotating bezel to navigate around screens is also really fun, especially in comparison to the sad little capacitive button on the Fitbit lol. Web browsing is also a neat feature which surprisingly holds up after all these years - I was able to read stuff on harija.moe perfectly fine! 

I also got a cool little rainbow watch band (remember how lots of fidget spinners back in the day had this oil slick/iridescent look?).
