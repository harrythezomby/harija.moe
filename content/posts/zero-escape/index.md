## Really Good Visual Novel
So.. I recently just finished the Zero Escape series, with 98.7 hours on the Nonary Games (999 and VLR), as well as 42.8 on ZTD. It was a pretty awesome read, coming in the hopes of something similar to Danganronpa, it has its own sort of charm and character.

## Favourite Game
In my opinion, 999 was by far the best game in the series, as it was just super immersive and the story, characters, and simple artstyle were great.

## VLR and ZTD
VLR's artstyle sure did take a bit to get used to, but after the initial shock of the cartoon-ey-ness the story was also pretty great. Once again with ZTD, the art style was interesting, and the story was easy to get immersed in after a bit.
