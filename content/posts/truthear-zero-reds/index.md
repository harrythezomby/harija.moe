## Background
Wanting to get a little bit more into audio, and hearing lots of good things about IEMs offering amazing audio experiences on the cheap, I decided to dive into the rabbit hole with this set being my first.

## Where I Got Them
Rather than buying off of something like Amazon or AliExpress, which in hindsight after becoming much more experienced in the field of IEMs and audio in general I would tend to prefer thanks to their typically cheaper prices, I got these from some funky audio store which was run by some guy in a warehouse since they were surprisingly a couple of dollars cheaper than what they were on Amazon at the time IIRC. 

## First Impressions
I thought the box was pretty nice, and after actually trying the IEMs, thought they sounded really good too, especially with my EQ with `easyeffects` on Linux, as well as `viper4android` on my phone. Back then, I was basically a noob in terms of IEMs, so I couldn't really review these based on sound alone. Although I could tell that the fit with them with my ears wasn't particularly great, especially with the nozzle on this set being pretty large.

A little while later, I also got a Tripowin Zonie cable for it, although I later replaced it with the pink colorway.

## Conclusion
Overall, these IEMs pulled me into the never-ending rabbit hole, with them eventually becoming the catalyst for me getting into IEMs themselves (obviously), Lossless audio (i.e., flacs, wavs, etc), Massive hard drives to store all this lossless music (lol), and so much more, making them somewhat of a domino leading to a spiral of interests for me personally.

If you wanna learn more about the other IEMs I use (I've collected about 10 so far as of writing this), I've written a bit about them [here in my uses + setup section](/uses/#iems).

Thanks for reading!
