## Uses:
Here's a bit of info on what I use day-to-day on my computers.
## Main Stuff
![Laptop Arch](/img/uses/laptopdesktop.jpg)
- I use vanilla [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) btw. I love its customizability and the fact that it only has as much bloat as I want it to!
- For my window manager, I use [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/). Hypr's silky smooth animations are great, especially on high refresh monitors, and despite Wayland's bugginess with Nvidia especially, its been working great on my 2070 Super PC, as well as my all AMD laptop.
- Along with Hypr, I use [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) for the status bar on the top, to tweak stuff like volume and view a bit of basic system info.
- I also use [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as my app launcher and power menu, and I've added buttons to my Waybar to open these, although hotkeys work too.
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is my go-to terminal, mainly since I've grown used to it, being Hyprland's default terminal and all. It's pretty fast and customizable too which is nice. Paired with Kitty, I use zsh for my shell, along with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
## Other Applications
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) for basic text-editting, including editting config files.
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) for heavier coding and bigger projects.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) for web-browsing, along with [Arkenfox's custom user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) for increased privacy and security and less tracking/telemetry.
- [KDE's Dolphin](https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/) for file browsing. I love its themeability with regular QT Themes.
- [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) and [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) for managing things on my server while on Windows.

## Server + Sites
- I run [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/) on my server. It's a stable enterprise distro, and a downstream RHEL clone.
- I build all my sites with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is great for creating fast static sites.
