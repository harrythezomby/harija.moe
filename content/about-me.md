## Gaming:
I love playing all sorts of games, ranging from Racing/Driving Sims, to FPS’, to Japanese Anime and Visual Novel games. My favorite games of all time include the Forza Motorsport and Horizon series (although I’m not a fan of the newer ones), Danganronpa, Higurashi and Umineko No Naku Koro Ni, Quake and Doom, and Euro Truck Simulator. Over the years I’ve played on lots of different consoles such as the Xbox 360 and more recently, the Nintendo Switch, however nowadays I stick with PC.

## All Things Tech:
I started out with my mom’s Windows XP Desktop back when I was only 3 years old, and soon got a first gen iPad after that. So, over the years I’ve been through lots of generations of tech and still have a burning passion for it!

## Mountain Biking:
I recently got into mountain biking with my Marin Bobcat Trail 3, which I’ve been having lots of fun upgrading, and hitting the local trails with. So far, I’ve upgraded a few different parts, and I have a post going into more detail.

## Music:
I love 80s-00s Dance Music! My favorite genres are Drum and Bass, and Italo Disco. In terms of DnB, I love dark, eerie, and atmospheric Neurofunk and Tech step from the late 90s to 00s. Whereas with Italo Disco, I like unique tracks that just sound good to me. I also like similar genres such as Euro Disco, Hi-NRG, and more.
