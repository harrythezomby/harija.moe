## Background
So, I was bored one weekend and just felt like spray painting my PC case after the thought crossing my mind a few times in the past. I only painted the front panel and side panel since everything else was riveted on. After sanding everything down, applying some white undercoat/primer, and then a layer of fluorescent pink, I think the end result was way better than I (as a rookie painter) thought it'd be - beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all...

Pretty cool painting setup right!?

### Not the Best of Painters
As you can see from those crazy drips and the straight up uneven coat, I'm not the best spray painter in the world. But hey, it was loads of fun!

## End Result
I actually think it looks pretty good from certain angles. The top is bald though (so not from the top)...
