## Introduction
This is an older project, as I’ve since lost most of my interest in sim-racing and driving thanks to getting my Learners License in real life. A few years back, I got a Logitech g923 along with the Logitech Shifter to get into Sim racing:

## Deep Dish Wheel
As you can see in the picture above, I did try upgrading the shift knob of the shifter with this interesting long metal knob I found on AliExpress. However, after seeing quite a few Youtubers with deep dish wheels on their G29s, G920s and G923s, I decided to try it for myself. I ordered an Alcantara deep dish with blue accents from AliExpress, and the adapter to fit it on the wheelbase from eBay. Surprisingly, the actual wheel coming from China arrived a few days faster than the adapter which came from another state of Australia. Here’s a pic of the deep dish:

## Switching Out The Wheels
The process of switching out the stock wheel for the deep dish was fairly straightforward – I had to first take the old wheel and motherboard off, and then screw the motherboard onto the wheelbase itself, before screwing in the adapter to the front followed by the deep dish. Here’s the finished product:

## Post Upgrade + Shifter Mod
After the upgrade, the wheel felt great – although the wheel’s force feedback was slightly reduced, not to mention the distance of the wheel from the paddle shifters – making it pretty difficult to shift with them. However, since this is a real car steering wheel, it makes sims way more immersive thanks to the substantially increased diameter compared to the stock wheel. I also installed the Clixbeetle tactile shifter mod from nolitto3d for the shifter which also greatly improved the shifter’s feel and performance, as well as some shifter handles such as the 3d printed Sparco one - which I forgot to dive into deeper in this post.


Thanks for reading!
