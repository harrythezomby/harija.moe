## Beginning
Back in around Q3 2020, my old ROG GL552VW gaming laptop with a 960M and i7 6700HQ was starting to get really slow, and unable to play newer games at the 60fps mark, and struggling to even get 30fps in some cases – which is why I decided to build my pc:

I already had most of my peripherals prior to the PC, such as the Corsair K68 Red keyboard I picked up during my Osu phase. My original specs were as follows:
- Motherboard: MSI B450 Carbon Max Wifi
- GPU: RTX 2070 Super Asus Dual
- CPU: Ryzen 5 3600x
- Ram: Corsair Vengeance LPX 2×8 3200mhz
- Psu: Nonmodular Cooler Master Mwe 750 Gold
- Case: Antec DF600 Flux
- As well as all the fans that came with it.


## First Upgrade: Case Fans
About a year or so after that, I made my first upgrade, which were some Amazon ‘ez-diy-fab’ brand ARGB ring fans. Here’s a pic, along with what was my online school setup at the time:

## Desk and Sim Setup
Another year after that, I finally upgraded my desk to a Eureka Ergonomic ‘gaming desk’, since my old one was very, very wobbly, not to mention all the times my legs bumped into the back. Here’s a couple of pics, including with my G923 which I also got around the time for games like Forza and Euro Truck Simulator:

## Monitors
Trying out some old monitors from my childhood:

Soon my main monitor started having these weird artefacts after a cold start, with them disappearing once the monitor ‘warmed up’ after around 5 minutes or so. This was pretty annoying, so I upgraded to a 200hz MSI ultrawide for my main monitor, whilst using the old Viewsonic as a second monitor, as the lines weren’t too big an issue for a second screen:

A while after that, I found a couple of 90hz Lenovo ultrawides for AU$250 each, which looked pretty similar from the front to my main monitor, so I picked up two of them for a more immersive sim experience. After a bit of tinkering with custom resolutions and monitor timings, I got the three of them to work together with Nvidia surround to stretch my games and sims across:

One of my friends (who goes by UntitledDuck) was upgrading to Corsair QL fans, so he gave me 4 of his old LL120’s along with the Rgb controller:

Later, I decided to get a monitor arm since each monitor’s stand was taking up a lot of desk space. However, the arm was a bit small so I’m no longer able to curve the monitors inward for Sim games like I was before, but the ability to go vertical is a big plus for things like web browsing and coding:

## Recent Upgrades
Last week (as of writing this), I got a Cooler Master Illusion ML360 AIO, mainly for the included ARGB controller, which allowed me to utilize OpenRGB to the fullest (more on that on a future post). I also got some more RAM – 2 sticks of 8gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 3600mhz. (Yes, I’m mixing ram, and yes, its stable… so far):

I decided to move my PC up to my desk to admire the rgb to the fullest, so I also moved the fans of the AIO to under the radiator:

## Stay Tuned
So far, this is what the PC looks like. However, I have a bunch of cool (and cheap!) goodies coming from AliExpress to play around with in the PC, so stay tuned for the incoming post!


Thanks for reading!
